### Data Format
The extension sends the following JSON payload to your webhook endpoint:
```json
{
  "sessionStartTime": "2023-05-15T14:30:45.123Z",
  "sessionStopTime": "2023-05-15T15:45:12.456Z",
  "date": "2023-05-15",
  "projectName": "Project Name",
  "durationSeconds": 4467
}
```

## Data Structure

Time tracking data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "projects": {
    "Project 1": {
      "totalSeconds": 3600,
      "entries": {
        "2023-05-15": 1800,
        "2023-05-16": 1800
      }
    },
    "Project 2": {
      "totalSeconds": 7200,
      "entries": {
        "2023-05-15": 3600,
        "2023-05-17": 3600
      }
    }
  },
  "activeState": {
    "projectName": "Currently Active Project",
    "startTime": 1684157445123
  },
  "lastTrackedProjectName": "Most Recently Tracked Project",
